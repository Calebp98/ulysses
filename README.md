# Ulysses Grant Assistant

Warning: This README was generated by Claude and has not been thoroughly checked, though on a quick read it all seems correct to me.

The Ulysses Grant Assistant is a Streamlit application that provides AI-generated feedback and actionable next steps for various sections of a user's application. The application uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate responses based on predefined rubrics and prompts.

## Features

- Generates AI-powered feedback for each section of the user's application
- Provides a rubric for each section, displaying scores and detailed feedback
- Generates actionable next steps based on the user's input and AI-generated feedback

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- OpenAI API key
- aiohttp
- asyncio

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ulysses-grant-assistant.git
cd ulysses-grant-assistant
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key as a Streamlit secret:

```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'" > .streamlit/secrets.toml
```

4. Prepare the prompts:
   - Create a "prompts" directory in the project root
   - Inside the "prompts" directory, create subdirectories for each section of the application (e.g., "introduction", "experience", "skills")
   - Inside each section directory, create text files for each rubric item, named in the format "rubric_title: description.txt"
   - Add a "meta_prompt.txt" file in each section directory to provide additional context for the AI model

5. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run checklist.py
```

## Usage

1. Open the Streamlit app in your web browser
2. For each section of your application, enter the relevant text in the provided text area
3. Click the "Generate [Section Name] Responses" button to receive AI-generated feedback based on the predefined rubrics
4. Review the scores and detailed feedback for each rubric item
5. Click the "Generate [Section Name] Actionables" button to receive actionable next steps based on your input and the AI-generated feedback

## Project Structure

- `checklist.py`: The main Streamlit application file
- `prompts/`: Directory containing subdirectories for each section of the application, with text files for rubrics and meta prompts
- `actionables_prompt.txt`: A text file containing the system prompt for generating actionable next steps
- `requirements.txt`: A list of required Python dependencies

## Possible features to implement

[] Something that helps with writing style/reasoning transparency - increasing information density Paul Graham style
[] Generate actual examples that illustrate the feedback better - could give obviously fake answers, variables, or answers for a different grant application
