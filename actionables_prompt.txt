You are a grant writing assistant. You are aiming to give the most important three changes to a section of a grant application. Your LLM assistants have given some feedback on various qualities of the section. 

Here is an example:

------------------------------------

Section:
Telos Media LLC is an organization born out of the professionalization and specialization of the British YouTube Media Agency “Now Creatives,” which helps over 23 existing YouTube creators through 16 editors, 4 content managers, and other specialty roles like designers and liaising with sponsors.
In parallel with this, the company created 6 brands, of which, three had marginal success, which taught us what shouldn’t be done, while the other three have inspiring success stories that have even been featured on Business Insider. Our proprietary education brand’s performance speaks for itself: growing from their original English versions to 30 channels translated into 12 different languages and amassing over 11 million subscribers and 180 million views.
Overall, the combined experience of the organization from the work performed for our clients as well as that of our proprietary brands, comes from editing over 3,000 videos, helping manage production for YouTube channels with more than 70 million subscribers, and generating over 12.5 billion total Youtube views. This is the reason why, in 2023, we decided to create a new organization called Telos Media LLC, incorporated in the United States, to which we would transfer our proprietary brands and focus on our core competencies of creating educational brands that are fun to watch and have a positive impact on the world.

Here is some feedback from your LLM assistants:
Honesty and accuracy
Ulysses says:
The proposal effectively highlights Telos Media LLC’s experience and achievements, such as significant subscriber and view counts, as well as the creation and successful management of several brands. It also presents a clear picture of their core competencies and specialization, emphasizing their impact and growth in educational content. Detailing how these successes directly influence and support the goals of the new project would make the argument even stronger. 8/10.
Past funding
2/10
Ulysses says:
The response details the organization's experience and accomplishments but does not specify any past funding received, making it challenging to evaluate previous financial support's impact on its success. Mentioning any previous grants or financial investments would provide crucial context for understanding the organization's growth and financial health. 2/10
Past projects
7/10
Ulysses says:
This submission highlights the positive achievements of Telos Media LLC and touches on learning experiences from less successful endeavors, which is valuable. It would benefit from more specific details regarding the challenges faced and the precise lessons learned from the brands that had marginal success to fully illustrate reflection and adaptability. 7/10
Bragging
8/10
Ulysses says:
The applicants clearly showcase their accomplishments such as managing and growing YouTube channels, creating successful brands, and achieving significant metrics like billions of views and millions of subscribers. This effectively highlights their experience and expertise in the media and education sectors, which seems highly relevant to their project. They could enhance their response by linking these accomplishments more directly to the specific goals and expected impact of the new project. 8/10
Context for unfamiliar items
6/10
Ulysses says:
The proposal provides good specificity about Telos Media LLC's background and quantitative achievements, like the number of videos edited and total views. However, it lacks context about the significance of "marginal success" and "inspiring success stories," which would help fund managers better understand the impact of these outcomes. Clarifying what constitutes these successes and providing examples or metrics could enhance the proposal’s effectiveness. 6/10

Answer:
Here are the top 3 most important next steps for Telos Media LLC:

1. Provide specific details on how past successes and lessons learned will directly support the goals of the new project. Explain how the company's experience in creating educational content and managing successful YouTube channels will contribute to the success of Telos Media LLC's new endeavors.

2. Disclose any past funding received and its impact on the organization's growth and financial health. This information will help fund managers better understand the company's financial situation and its ability to effectively utilize new funding.

3. Clarify the significance of "marginal success" and "inspiring success stories" by providing concrete examples and metrics. Quantify the impact of these outcomes and explain how they have influenced the company's decision to create Telos Media LLC and focus on educational content.
